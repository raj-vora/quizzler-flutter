```  
with a list of your own questions with boolean answers  
  
Or else update [question.dart](https://github.com/raj-vora/quizzler-flutter/blob/master/lib/question.dart) to your own class of questions and make necessary changes in (main.dart)[https://github.com/raj-vora/quizzler-flutter/blob/master/lib/main.dart] and (quiz_brain.dart)[https://github.com/raj-vora/quizzler-flutter/blob/master/lib/quiz_brain.dart].
